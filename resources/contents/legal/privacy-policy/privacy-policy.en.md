## 3. General information and mandatory information

### Data protection

The operators of these websites and its pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.

Whenever you use our websites, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.

We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e., through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third-party access.

### Information about the responsible party (referred to as the "controller" in the GDPR)

The data processing controller of our websites is:

Jasper Raddatz<br>
Colognifornia<br>
Salzburger Weg 47<br>
50858 Köln<br>
Germany

Phone: [+49 (0) 1573 84 08 326](tel:+4915738408326)<br>
Email: [privacy@colognifornia.com](mailto:privacy@colognifornia.com)

The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).

### Storage duration

Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.

### General information on the legal basis for the data processing on our websites

If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1 (a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49 (1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on § 25 (1) TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.

### Information on the data transfer to third-party countries that are not secure under data protection law and the transfer to US companies that are not DPF-certified

We use, among other technologies, tools from companies located in third-party countries that are not safe under data protection law, as well as US tools whose providers are not certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF). If these tools are enabled, your personal data may be transferred to and processed in these countries. We would like you to note that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in third countries that are insecure in terms of data protection law.

We would like to point out that the US, as a secure third-party country, generally has a level of data protection comparable to that of the EU. Data transfer to the US is therefore permitted if the recipient is certified under the "EU-US Data Privacy Framework" (DPF) or has appropriate additional assurances. Information on transfers to third-party countries, including the data recipients, can be found in this Privacy Policy.

### Recipients of personal data

In the scope of our business activities, we cooperate with various external parties. In some cases, this also requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only disclose personal data to external parties if this is required as part of the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the disclosure of this data. When using processors, we only disclose
personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract on data processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.

### Revocation of your consent to the processing of data

A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.

### <span class="text-highlighted">Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</span>

<strong class="text-highlighted">In the event that data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR, you have the right to at any time object to the processing of your personal data based on grounds arising from your unique situation. This also applies to any profiling based on these provisions. To determine the legal basis, on which any processing of data is
based, please consult this Data Protection Declaration. If you log an objection, we
will no longer process your affected personal data, unless we are in a position to
present compelling protection worthy grounds for the processing of your data, that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or if the purpose of the processing is the claiming, exercising or defence of legal entitlements (objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR).</strong>

<strong class="text-highlighted">If your personal data is being processed in order to engage in direct advertising, you have the right to object to the processing of your affected personal data for the purposes of such advertising at any time. This also applies to profiling to the extent that it is affiliated with such direct advertising. If you object, your personal
data will subsequently no longer be used for direct advertising purposes (objection pursuant to Art. 21(2) GDPR).</strong>

### Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency

In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.

### Right to data portability

You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.

### Information about, rectification and eradication of data

Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to demand information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data at any time. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time.

### Right to demand processing restrictions

You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the following cases:

- In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
- If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.
- If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its eradication.
- If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.

If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.

### SSL and/or TLS encryption

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from "http://" to "https://" and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.

If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

### Rejection of unsolicited e-mails

We herewith object to the use of contact information published in conjunction with the mandatory information to be provided in our Legal Notice to send us promotional and information material that we have not expressly requested. The operators of this website and its pages reserve the express right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of promotional information, for instance via spam messages.

## 4. Recording of data on our websites

### Cookies

Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as "cookies". Cookies are small data packages that do not cause any damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or they are permanently archived on your device (permanent cookies). Session cookies are automatically deleted once you terminate your visit. Permanent cookies remain archived on your device until you actively delete them, or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.

Cookies can be issued by us (first-party cookies) or by third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies). Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services of third-party companies into websites (e.g., cookies for handling payment services).

Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically essential since certain website functions would not work in the absence of these cookies (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies may be used to analyze user behavior or for promotional purposes.

Cookies, which are required for the performance of electronic communication transactions, for the provision of certain functions you want to use (e.g., for the shopping cart function) or those that are necessary for the optimization (required cookies) of the website (e.g., cookies that provide measurable insights into the web audience), shall be stored on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, unless a different legal basis is cited. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the storage of required cookies to ensure the technically error-free and optimized provision of the operator's services. If your consent to the storage of the cookies and similar recognition technologies has been requested, the processing occurs exclusively on the basis of the consent obtained (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TDDDG); this consent may be revoked at any time.

You have the option to set up your browser in such a manner that you will be notified any time cookies are placed and to permit the acceptance of cookies only in specific cases. You may also exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in general or activate the delete-function for the automatic eradication of cookies when the browser closes. If cookies are deactivated, the functions of our websites may be limited.

Which cookies and services are used on our websites can be found in this privacy policy.

<button class="btn" onclick="klaro.show()">Open Cookie Settings</button>

### Consent with Klaro and our web service consent.colognifornia.com

Our websites use the open-source consent technology from Klaro to obtain your consent to store certain cookies on your device or for the use of certain technologies and to document this consent in a manner compliant with data protection regulations.

Klaro is integrated into our website(s) and runs in your browser without establishing a connection to the servers of the provider of Klaro.

If you grant or revoke your consent, the following data will be transmitted to a web service (Web API) developed by us under the domain consent.colognifornia.com for the documentation of your consent (for the hosting of this web service, please also refer to section "2. Hosting and processing by external service providers" of this privacy policy):

- Your consent(s) or the revocation of your consent(s)
- Your IP address
- Information about your browser and your device (user agent)
- Time of your consent on the website
- A randomly generated User-ID possibly stored in your browser to be able to allocate past consents to you if you have already given consent in your browser and device for our website(s)

Klaro and our web service stores a cookie in your browser in order to be able to allocate the consents granted to you or their revocation.

The data collected in this way is stored until you request us to delete it, delete the Klaro cookie or our consent cookie with your User-ID yourself, or until the purpose for storing the data no longer applies. Mandatory legal storage obligations remain unaffected.  

The use of Klaro and our web service consent.colognifornia.com is carried out to obtain and document the legally required consents for the use of cookies. The legal basis for this is Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.

Your User-ID for Cookie Consent: <span id="cookieConsentUserID">Not found</span>

### Server log files

The provider of our websites and its pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser communicates to us automatically. The information comprises:

- The type and version of browser used
- The used operating system
- Referrer URL
- The hostname of the accessing computer
- The time of the server inquiry
- The IP address

This data is not merged with other data sources.

This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the technically error free depiction and the optimization of the operator's website. In order to achieve this, server log files must be recorded.

### Contact form

If you submit inquiries to us via our contact form, the information provided in the contact form as well as any contact information provided therein will be stored by us in order to handle your inquiry and in the event that we have further questions. We will not share this information without your consent.

The processing of these data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, if your request is related to the execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your agreement (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.

The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain with us until you ask us to eradicate the data, revoke your consent to the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is being archived no longer exists (e.g., after we have concluded our response to your inquiry). This shall be without prejudice to any mandatory legal provisions, in particular retention periods.

### Request by e-mail or telephone

If you contact us by e-mail or telephone, your request, including all resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these data on without your consent.

These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the data are processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been obtained; the consent can be revoked at any time.

The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.

### Registration on our websites

You may have the option to register on our websites to be able to use additional website functions. We shall use the data you enter only for the purpose of using the respective offer or service you have registered for. The required information we request at the time of registration must be entered in full. Otherwise, we shall reject the registration.

modifications, we shall use the e-mail address provided during the registration process.

We shall process the data entered during the registration process on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).

#### Registration with GitHub

Instead of registering directly on this website, you can register with GitHub. The provider of this service is GitHub Inc., 88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.

To register with GitHub, you must only enter your GitHub login credentials and your corresponding password. GitHub will identify you and confirm your identity to our website.
When you sign in with GitHub, we may be able to use certain information in your account to complete your profile with us. You decide whether you want this information to be used and if so, which information it is, within the framework of your GitHub integration settings, which you can find here:<br>
[https://github.com/settings/applications](https://github.com/settings/applications)

In general, this involves the following data:

- Your GitHub username and name
- Your GitHub profile picture
- Your e-mail address stored with GitHub
- any other personal data from your profile, including all data from your profile that you have made publicly accessible

The data processing associated with GitHub's registration is based on our legitimate interest in making the registration process as simple as possible for our users (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). Since the use of the registration function is voluntary and the users themselves can decide on the respective access options, no conflicting predominant rights of the data subjects are apparent.

The company is certified in accordance with the "EU-US Data Privacy Framework" (DPF). The DPF is an agreement between the European Union and the US, which is intended to ensure compliance with European data protection standards for data processing in the US. Every company certified under the DPF is obliged to comply with these data protection standards. For further information, please visit the following website:<br>

### The comment and posting function on the website dev-community.de

When you use the comment or posting function on the website dev-community.de, information on the time the comment or post was generated and your e-mail-address and, if you are not posting anonymously, the username you have selected will be archived in addition to your comments or posts.

#### External processing of comment and post contents

At the time of the creation of a comment or post on the website dev-community.de, it is possible that the comment or post content may be further transmitted and processed externally. The purpose of this processing is to ensure that your comment or post is presented as uniformly and legibly as possible.

In order to guarantee the fastest possible processing, external hosting providers or servers are used, which can be found in this privacy policy under the heading "2. Hosting and processing by external service providers".

Your data will be stored temporarily (for max. a few seconds) on these servers during the processing and then immediately deleted again. Furthermore, the data transmission is exclusively encrypted.

Personal data, as far as these are not contained in the comment or post text written by you, are not transmitted.

#### Storage of the IP address

Our comment and posting function stores the IP addresses of all users who enter comments or posts. Given that we do not review the comments or posts prior to publishing them, we need this information in order to take action against the author in the event of rights violations, such as defamation or propaganda.

#### Subscribing to comments or posts

As a user of this website, you have the option to subscribe to comments or posts after you have registered. You will receive a confirmation e-mail, the purpose of which is to verify whether you are the actual holder of the provided e-mail address. You can deactivate this function at any time by following a respective link in the information e-mails. The data entered in conjunction with subscriptions to comments or posts will be deleted in this case. However, if you have communicated this information to us for other purposes and from a different location (e.g., when subscribing to the newsletter), the data shall remain in our possession.

#### Storage period for comments and posts

Comments or posts and any affiliated information shall be stored by us and remain on this website until the content the comment or post pertained to has been deleted in its entirety or if the comments or posts had to be deleted for legal reasons (e.g., insulting comments).

#### Legal basis

Comments or posts are stored on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You have the right to revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent us an informal notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.

## 5. Analysis tools and advertising

### Matomo

Our websites use the open-source web analysis service Matomo.

Through Matomo, we are able to collect and analyze data on the use of our website-by-website visitors. This enables us to find out, for instance, when which page views occurred and from which region they came. In addition, we collect various log files (e.g. IP address, referrer, browser, and operating system used) and can measure whether our website visitors perform certain actions (e.g. clicks, purchases, etc.).

The use of this analysis tool is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the analysis of user patterns, in order to optimize the operator's web offerings and advertising. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and §25 (1) TDDDG, insofar the consent includes the storage of cookies or the access to information in the user's end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. This consent can be revoked at any
time.

#### IP anonymization

For analysis with Matomo we use IP anonymization. Your IP address is shortened before the analysis, so that it is no longer clearly assignable to you.

#### Analysis without cookies

We have configured Matomo in such a way that Matomo will not store cookies in your browser, unless you give us your explicit consent to do so.

#### Hosting

We host Matomo exclusively on our own servers so that all analysis data remains with us and is not passed on. You can find more information on our hosting providers under section "2. Hosting and processing by external service providers" of this Privacy Policy.

#### Opt-out

## 6. Newsletter

### Newsletter data

If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on one of our websites, we will need from you an e-mail address as well as information that allow us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and consent to the receipt of the newsletter. No further data shall be collected or shall be collected only on a voluntary basis. We shall use such data only for the sending of the requested information and shall not share such data with any third parties.

The processing of the information entered into the newsletter subscription form shall occur exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You may revoke the consent you have given to the archiving of data, the e-mail address, and the use of this information for the sending of the newsletter at any time, for instance by clicking on the "Unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data processing transactions that have taken place to date.

The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter or the newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter or after the purpose has ceased to apply. We reserve the right to delete or block e-mail addresses from our newsletter distribution list at our own discretion within the scope of our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.

Data stored for other purposes with us remain unaffected.

After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist, if such action is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this purpose and not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite. <strong class="text-bold">You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</strong>

The website operator has a legitimate interest in the protection of the operator's websites against abusive automated spying and against spam. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TDDDG, insofar the consent includes the storage of cookies or the access to information in the user's end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG.

## 8. Online marketing and partner programs

### Affiliate Programs on our websites

We participate in affiliate partner programs. In conjunction with affiliate partner programs, ads of businesses (advertisers) are placed on websites of other enterprises within the affiliate partner network (publisher). If you click on one of these affiliate ads, you will be transferred to the promoted offer. If you should subsequently engage in a certain transaction (conversion), the publisher will receive a respective commission in exchange for the service. To be able to compute the commission amount, the affiliate network operator must be in a position to track the ad that has resulted in you seeing the offer and in you completing the predefined transaction. To make this possible, cookies or comparable recognition technologies are deployed (e.g., device fingerprinting).

Data is stored and analyzed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the correct computation of its affiliate compensation. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TDDDG, insofar the consent includes the storage of cookies or the access to information in the user’s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. This consent can be revoked at any time.

We participate in the following affiliate programs:

#### Netcup affiliate program

The operator of the affiliate program is netcup GmbH, Daimlerstr. 25, 76185 Karlsruhe, Germany.

When you click on a Netcup affiliate link, you will be redirected to the Netcup website, where it may be recorded via a recognition technology (e.g., cookies) that you have reached the Netcup offers via our website; this is done for the purpose of billing the affiliate commission.
