                <p class="card__text">
                    As service providers, we are liable for own contents of these websites according to Paragraph 7, Sect. 1
                    German Telemedia Act (TMG). However, according to Paragraphs 8 to 10 German Telemedia Act (TMG),
                    service providers are not obligated to permanently monitor submitted or stored information or to search for
                    evidences that indicate illegal activities.

                <p class="card__text">
                    Legal obligations to removing information or to blocking the use of information remain unchallenged. In this
                    case, liability is only possible at the time of knowledge about a specific violation of law. Illegal contents will
                    be removed immediately at the time we get knowledge of them.

                    linked websites cannot be imposed without reasonable indications that there has been a violation of law.
                    Illegal links will be removed immediately at the time we get knowledge of them.
